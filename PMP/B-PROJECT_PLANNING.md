## Project Management Life cycle

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart which allows HereNew Inc  staff to follow the guidelines and achieved the milestone from time to time. The project life cycle WBS breakdown the task and work of every member such as project manager into several modules. Every member has their own roles and part in every stage of the life cycle based on the constructed WBS.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

## Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved.

In this Fruit Spoilage Detection System project, we need to identify the scope of the project. For instance, the fruit is reflecting to lights and fruit with sticker or package will not be acceptable. Besides, this project scope down the limit of the project by only detect fruit. Therefore, other object such as vegetables might not be able to use this system.
