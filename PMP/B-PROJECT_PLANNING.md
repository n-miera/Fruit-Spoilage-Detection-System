## Project Management Life cycle

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart which allows HereNew Inc  staff to follow the guidelines and achieved the milestone from time to time. The project life cycle WBS breakdown the task and work of every member such as project manager into several modules. Every member has their own roles and part in every stage of the life cycle based on the constructed WBS.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

As for the Fruit Spoilage Detection Project, the system WBS are represented as follow. This WBS is constructed to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as interface design, MATLABâ€˜s Libraries Management, Fruit Detection and Fruit Spoilage Recognition:

## Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved.

In this Fruit Spoilage Detection System project, we need to identify the scope of the project. For instance, the fruit is reflecting to lights and fruit with sticker or package will not be acceptable. Besides, this project scope down the limit of the project by only detect fruit. Therefore, other object such as vegetables might not be able to use this system.

## Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)
| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Quality</br>(Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program) | 1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system confused with fruit shape recognition</br>2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model is biased towards a certain design of the fruits.| How: The output result always segmented the wrong part of the fruit spoilage</br>When: The quality problem of will be determined during the unit testing phase| Assign one member to keep on collecting the data day to day and increased the dataset until a satisfied result is determined. |
