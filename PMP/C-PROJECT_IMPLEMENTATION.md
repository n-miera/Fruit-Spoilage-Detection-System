# PROJECT-IMPLEMENTATION

## Deliverables:

Hardware Requirement: 

The hardware that is used for this project is a laptop with specification of intel core i5 7th gen with 8GB of RAM.

Software Requirement: 

For this project, we used MATLAB software to train the system to detect the spoilage in fruits. Other software used are Microsoft Word for documentation and Microsoft Powerpoint for presentation.

Intelligent System Architecture: 

This project used the image processing and pattern recognition technique which are image enhancing and image segmentation.

Project Outcomes:

Example of output that appears when we input an image of fruit that is spoiled and its histogram equalization:

The histogram shows the distribution of dark and bright areas in the image. The picture is shown to have a larger distribution on the dark side of the histogram compared to the light side so it is detected that the fruit is spoiled.

The system will show a message box informing that the fruit is spoilt and not edible.

The histogram shows the distribution of dark and bright areas in the image. The picture is shown to have a lower distribution on the dark side of the histogram compared to the light side so it is detected that the fruit is not spoiled.

Then, the system will show a message box informing that the fruit is not spoiled and is edible.
