## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT

### Project Summary

Fruits are one of the most important things in our life. This is because fruits provide a lot of nutrients, vitamins and minerals that are good for our body. Humans need to consume fruits regularly in order to stay healthy. We can see that there are a lot of different types of fruits around the world as they come in different shapes, colors and variants. But despite all of the good parts of fruits, it also has some bad parts which is fruit spoilage or rottennes. Food spoiling ensues when microbiological, chemical, or physical changes occur which makes the food become inedible and unpalatable to consumers. 

The method to identify fruit spoilage that is used currently consumes quite a lot of time so it is not really effective. Hence, the objective of this project is to apply an automatic detection of fruit spoilage so that fruits that have started to spoil can be identified much earlier and will take less time. Early detection in fruit spoilage can also save economic loss since it would not affect the other patch.

### Project Name: Fruit Spoilage Detection System

### Team Members: 

1. NATASHA AMIERA BINTI AZMAN (PROJECT MANAGER) B032120013
2. LIM SHEN HUI B032020036
3. NUR SYUHADA BINTI AZHAR B032010378

### Objectives:

* To detect the spoilage on fruits by using image recognition technique
* To prevent more fruits from being affected to spoilage from another fruits
* To apply AI techniques in detecting the patterns of spoilage on fruits
