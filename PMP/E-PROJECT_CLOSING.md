#### FRUIT SPOILAGE DETECTION SYSTEM

##### 1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The fruit spoilage detection system is developed with the intention of making a system that can make the process of detecting spoilt fruits less time-consuming and also help detect spoiled fruits before it is shipped to reduce loss. This closely follows the company's aim of developing systems that are helpful to the society.

##### 2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS

After completion of the system, we are able to ensure that the system has an accuracy rate of 50% and still needs further fixes as fruits that are dark might be detected as spoilt despite being safe to eat.

##### 3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE

The team members of the project stuck to the planned Gantt chart therefore the progress at the end follows the original planned schedule of the project.

##### 4.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL BUDGET

The actual budget closely follows the original budget plan for the project. This means that there was no problems in the development and folows the budget plan from start to finish. The project did not use any extra money for whichever plans.
