# Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System

This is a project done in order to help in process of detecting the condition of a fruit to decide whether the fruit is spoilt or not spoilt. This project use Image Processing techniques during the development.

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization.
