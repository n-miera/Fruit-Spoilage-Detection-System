# Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System

This is a project done in order to help in process of detecting the condition of a fruit to decide whether the fruit is spoilt or not spoilt. This project use Image Processing techniques during the development.

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization.

[Project Summary](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/A-PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)

Project summary gives a short look over the projects objective as well as the details of team members.

[Project Planning](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/B-PROJECT_PLANNING.md)

The planning process involves the process of identifying the scope and needs of the client. The deliverables in this section are such as Gantt Chart, and Work Breakdown Structure(WBS).

[Project Implementation](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/C-PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

The implementation process involves the process of developing the system. This involves finding out the software requirements, system structure, expected outcome of the system and others.

[Project Execution](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/D-PROJECT_EXECUTION.md)

The execution process involves the process of overseeing the code implementation and results of the project and documenting the procesess.

[Project Closing](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/E-PROJECT_CLOSING.md)

Project closing is done at the end project development lifecycle. This section involves documents involved in closing a project such as budget overview, resource overview, result overview and lessons learned throughout the development period to identify what went right and what went wrong.

## Sample-Result

Result using MATLAB

#### Spoilt-fruit-result-example

Figure 1 show the histogram equalization of the image which shows the intensity values of image pixels. This takes in an image and shows the intensity of the pixels in the image. Figure 2 shows the original image (left), the image converted into grayscale (middle) and the binarized form of the image (right). The reason the image needs to be converted into grayscale is so that the histogram could detect the difference in pixel intesity easily. The image is then binarized in order to enhance the difference in hues of the image. This helps ease the detection
of spoilt fruit areas on the fruit. If there is a higher area of spoilage(dark area) detected on the fruit, the code will denote the fruit as spoilt as shown in the message box in Figure 3.

#### Unspoilt-fruit-result-example

Figure 4 shows the histogram equalization of the middle image in Figure 5. The system detects the difference in the area of pixel intensity and calculates it to determine whether a fruit is spoilt or not. Based on the graph we can see that the area of distribution on the left side of the histogram is small. Figure 5 shows the original image (left), the image converted into grayscale (middle) and the binarized form of the image (right). Figure 6 shows a message that tells us that the fruit is not spoilt. As we can visibly see in the leftmost image in figure 5, this is correctly interpretted. Thus this shows that this method can be used to determine whether a fruit is spoilt or not.
