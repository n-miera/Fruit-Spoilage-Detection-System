# Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System

This is a project done in order to help in process of detecting the condition of a fruit to decide whether the fruit is spoilt or not spoilt. This project use Image Processing techniques during the development.

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization.

Project summary gives a short look over the projects objective as well as the details of team members.

[Project Planning](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/B-PROJECT_PLANNING.md)

The planning process involves the process of identifying the scope and needs of the client. The deliverables in this section are such as Gantt Chart, and Work Breakdown Structure(WBS).

[Project Implementation](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/C-PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

The implementation process involves the process of developing the system. This involves finding out the software requirements, system structure, expected outcome of the system and others.

[Project Execution](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/D-PROJECT_EXECUTION.md)

The execution process involves the process of overseeing the code implementation and results of the project and documenting the procesess.

[Project Closing](https://github.com/n-miera/Fruit-Spoilage-Detection-System/blob/main/PMP/E-PROJECT_CLOSING.md)

Project closing is done at the end project development lifecycle. This section involves documents involved in closing a project such as budget overview, resource overview, result overview and lessons learned throughout the development period to identify what went right and what went wrong.
